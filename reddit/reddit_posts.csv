This weeks sheet is up.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eln8p99doK0GBOZJOD2obOk3jzaS920yom4wt7RUfZ0/edit?usp=sharing

I've included a new tab based off a screener for individual equities using different filters. 

What I look for is really:

Decent P/E

Debt to equity ratio of &lt;=175%

ROE &gt;=10%

ROA &gt;=10% (looking for stocks that don't require debt leverage for ROA)

Positive P/E estimate for 2018

Net profit margin &gt;=5%

Then sort from there.

Here are the column descriptions:

Symbol - duh

Company	- duh

Sector	-duh 

D/E	- Debt to Equity (expressed as % so 175% = 1.75/1)

NPM	- Net Profit Margin

Est. EPS Growth	 - estimated EPS growth from 2017 to 2018 estimate

Rev Growth - revenue growth from prior TTM to this TTM	

P/E - current Price to Earnings

P/E Est 2018 - estimated P/E

P/C - Price to Cash Flow (default sorted)

P/B	- Price to Book

ROE	- Return on Equity

ROA	- Return on  Assets

Distance from PT - Distance from price target per Merrill Lynch (who I like the most). A positive numbers means it is X% **under** the target (so a $9 stock with a $10 PT would be 10%). A negative number means it is X% over the target.

BofA Merrill Lynch rating (low is good)

CFRA rating (high is good)

Morningstar (high is good)

The long and short of it is, Intel is introducing a drastic security measure into their chips through a patch.  It is called KASLR.  This is effective; but at a cost.  A 30-40% performance cost.  Almost all large data/cloud providers (Amazon, Google, etc.) use Intel chips.  

People suspect this is because it's *rumored* a bug exists in the Intel CPUs that allow code to be run across multiple virtual machines on the same host.  A HUGE security vulnerability.  Think, Joe the hacker opening an AWS account and accessing all data on that machine (or even network) completely unrestricted.

I would expect AMD to move upwards heavily on this rumor.

I mean, no sane company would halve the performance of their product without GREAT reason.  And AMD is not doing this.

As you can see this has been quite the ride from $2.5 and I do not believe we are done yet. We just set a record on a daily consumption (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-02/america-is-burning-more-gas-than-ever-as-chill-grips-east-chart) and the weather forcast looks like we will remain cold for at least another 10 days. So what does that mean? When comparing storage levels (currently at 3,318) with past years levels and comparing this weeks and next weeks demand I estimate a draw of 250-400 this week and 200-350 next week putting us at around 2014 levels that supported a price range of ~$4.50-$6. Do I actually believe we will get anywhere near $6? no but I think hovering around $4 is a real possibility in the next 30 days and you should to.
