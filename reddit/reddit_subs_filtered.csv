Back in 2016 after their first drug called Ocaliva was on the market, 19 people died, but those people were dying either way. PBC is a bitch. Doctors were giving bad doses, people were starting the meds sick as fuck already, and with better education between the company and the doctors, they'd have been fine. I imagine they've learned this. Basically, though, the drug wasn't what killed people. Nonetheless, investors freaked out and in September it dropped 50%. The company is still working on that PBC treatment but also, more importantly, a treatment for NASH. NASH is a currently untreatable liver disease that is common and growing across the globe, affecting 2%- 5% of the USA. 

So if you get in now, it's undervalued and set to go pretty high if their trials go well. This is probably a long to some extent but I believe it could be very good.",2018-01-11 23:42:28,['ICPT']

0,$IQ DD Inside,"I saw a post somewhere asking for some actual iQIYI DD so I figured I would do some for myself as well to give myself some piece of mind on this new meme stock.

For all intents and purposes, we will use Netflix as a comparison, though as it stands, iQIYI has more revenue streams than Netflix does. Since IQ closed around $40 today, I went ahead and looked for when NFLX was around $40 and made a comparison between what IQ has for Q1 18' and NFLX Q3 13'.

(everything in thousands except price or if there is a unit)

(everything converted to USD)

||IQ (Q1 18')|NFLX (Q3 13')||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Price|$19|$44||
|P/E Ratio|undefined|68.88||
|Total Revenue|$757,510 | $1,105,999 ||
|Net Income|$(61,617)|$31,822 ||
|Net Income/EPS|$(0.31)|$0.54||
|Total Assets|$3,561,079 |$4,901,325 ||
|Total Liabilities|$2,235,974 |$3,696,955 ||
|w/ Shareholder Def.|$3,561,309 |$4,901,325 ||
|Total Paid Subscribers|\&gt;50,000|31,092||
|Revenue Streaming|$325,374 |$884,134 ||
|Total Revenue|$757,811 |$1,105,999 ||

iQIYI has had some incredible growth YoY and even between quarters, there is an article here [talking about the user growth](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/27/iqiyi-growth-accelerates-in-its-first-quarter-as-a.aspx). The analysts there suspect growth to slow down in the range of 42&amp;#37; to 48&amp;#37;. I went ahead and did a safe growth of 35&amp;#37;. This would be for Q1 19' and resulted in some new numbers:

|Total Revenue|1,022,638|
|:-|:-|
|Total Assets|4,807,456|
|Total Liabilities|3,018,564|
|  w/ Shareholder Def.|4,807,767|
|Total Revenue|1,023,044|

These numbers are essentially NFLX at $44 so from the book standpoint, it is pretty safe to say IQ is CAN BE valued around $44 if their growth holds up. IQ's current stock price almost assumes that growth has gone up 35&amp;#37; since March rather than a full year of growth.

Realistically, the stock should be priced around $30-35, but this is understandable as to why it is trading higher than where its American brother Netflix was at a similar growth period because of their new AI competition, board changes, and user growth. NFLX was at \~$63 a share when they had 50 million subscribers, IQ already has that many subscribers and its growing, and even more free users. They also make about the same amount off advertising with their free users which is great news and have other revenue streams and continue to make new partnerships and release news between earnings. Knowing where there are in comparison to Netflix as a baseline is great because I know that anything below $35 is an immediate buy for me.

Enjoy the numbers, correct me if I am wrong anywhere. I know my total revenue is different than what articles have posted for total revenue (e.g $777M) but I converted RMB to USD from their balance sheet. Currently long $IQ and looking to pick up more if it ever goes below $35 x (some genius IQ premium multiplier).

For you poorfags who can't afford $GOOG or $FB, this bitch gives you a good amount of exposure to both.

They also have a stake in NFLX, (3.93%, which I like) and TWTR (2.78% which I don't like).

As I'm long AMZN and NFLX, I like the fact that I get exposure to FB and GOOG in a more affordable and more diversified fashion.  I also think having some of the traditional telecomm dividend cash cows in this shit is good.

Cat food and pet medicine stock. Thanks to a massive oversupply of liberal arts degrees,  careerism trends, and feminist propaganda, 1-800-PetMeds ($PETS) has  seen booming growth in sales over the past year. In North America, young  adults are 8 times as likely to own a pet than a child, and pets are  now twice as likely to be vaccinated as children.

The  $30.6 billion U.S. pet food market is expected to grow 5.4% a year over  the next five years, but more importantly, the proliferation of  internet pornography continues to drive down marriage rates, and by  implication, drive up pet ($PETS) ownership rates, especially among  women.

$PETS uses an online model similar  to Amazon to disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and uses an  omni-channel approach to support rapid growth. Revenues are growing 13%  yoy and growth continues to be supported by unusually high prices on  prescription products.

The rising  standards of living for humans will trickle down to pets, and humans  will continue to spend more on pet health compared to how much we spend  on our own health. Long $PETS

0,"Get in on the $YEXT big thing - Earnings play, actual DD","This isn't a Seeking Alpha article so I'm gonna try to keep it short-ish Plus some of you would read a TL:DR on a tweet if it was a thing.  

Yext created a whole new market segment called DKM-digital knowledge management. They are a ten year old company which has been public for about a year. Going public allowed them access to capital which let them expand and win many partnerships this year including Yelp, TripAdvisor,Google and Amazon.  It's a simple product. On the surface they allow merchants and businesses to update the information that appears on search engines and review pages.  Under the hood it's a beautiful AI play with rich and complex ramifications.  The digital Knowledge Assistant interacts with companies and let's them know when and how to change their info. For instance if people are searching How many calories in a big Mac on their alexa, the KA will prompt the neighborhood Burger Restaurant to add the info to their website along with their hours of business and whatever else info is pertinent.  

-Management is stellar. Highly ranked on Glassdoor, recently named best place to work by Fortune. Keeps winning partnerships. Last big pop was a big win with Alexa 

-Expected revenue this quarter is 54 million ish. However, due to new features and partnerships I think this is a very conservative estimate.  Good chance of a big beat.  

-Last earnings call they mentioned a line about being worried about capital expenditures due to their spending on annual conference. Now they just announced David friggin Blaine will be entertaining them. Just an aside but I think this speaks as to just how confidant they are going into this report.  

-Company is currently cash flow positive, many catalysts this spring/summer, history of big beats.  

I bought calls and stock.

Edit: Earnings isn't till first week of Sept. Stock is currently range bound by about 5%. Possible to wait for a sale before buying. If you're a masochist and like being glued to your computer can wait till last week and write calls to capture theta/iv

The company reports earnings this Wednesday after market close, and is primed for a pop from the low following strong retail sector numbers earlier this week. 

L Brands has moved sharply downwards over the past two years as ""real beauty"" trends have pushed both retail competitors and institutional investors away from 'idealized' models and 'male-focused' lingerie products. This trend can only move so far however, and while larger sizes certainly exist, investors seem to have forgotten that Vic Secret holds a dominant brand and moat-protected competitive positioning in small-sized products aimed at younger women. The VS Fashion show is unrivaled among corporate names in viewership, and the list of names employed as Angels total a combined 100m followers on instagram. Additionally, overt feminist trends have stalled and begun to reverse in the Trump era.  

The stock currently trades at a tiny 6x P/E ratio, a number usually reserved for dead and dying companies. $LB however has posted 8% revenue growth its last quarterly, and has recently expanded into China with a huge flagship store in Shanghai, targeting overseas demand for American brand name products.

Recent separation from MetLife has created increases operating and hedging expenses but a lot of that should go down over the next 6-18 months. Basically just costs a lot of money to recreate all the operating and hedging stuff under a new company. The company is new but the business is old and undervalued by any and every metric. It's not a sure thing they turn it around this quarter and long-term growth is doubtful but the assets they hold are currently worth 25% more than the current stock price so there is limited downside risk.

#**Overview:**

Immune Design is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on developing treatments to enable the body’s own immune system to fight diseases.  Their focus lies on the oncology sector, having engineered technologies to activate the immune system’s natural ability to create tumor-specific cytotoxic T Cells to fight cancer.  Their belief is that their two main drug candidates will address what other therapies are currently lacking while having the potential to treat a broad patient population through either individual therapies or in conjunction with other mechanisms of action.  Although their main focus is the immuno-oncology, they believe that their candidates also have potential to serve in therapeutic realms such as infectious and allergic diseases as they have a few different collaboration and partnerships underway leveraging their GLAAS platforms.  

Immune Design’s management team, board of directors, and scientific advisory board boast a diverse group of individuals who don’t lack experience in the industry.  The CEO, Carlos Paya, has served as Vice President at Eli Lilly, President of Elan Corporation, and was also a professor of Medicine, Immunology, and Pathology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  The company also has an extensive list of Doctors and PhD researchers backing the company’s advisory board and management team.
  

#**Pipeline:**

The company currently has 6 different products in their pipeline ranging from Preclinical to Phase II.  Still in the early stages of development, the company is actively seeking growth and partnerships to solidify their financial and developmental future.  Each of their GLAAS products, 3 of them, have partnerships lined up for the development and licensing of the candidates.  These partnerships include Sanofi, MedImmune, and Sanofi Pasteur.   To match their product collaborations, they are also working in conjunction with Merck and Genetech in clinical collaborations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of their immuno-oncology products. 
Their immuno-oncology pipeline also has 3 candidates targeting different forms of cancer.  Their entire pipeline is as follows:

 

#**Specific Drug:**

While the company has several different products filling their pipeline, we are concerned with CMB305.  Immune Design has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Genetech, a member of Roche, to better evaluate the safety and efficacy of CMB305 cancer immunotherapy when combined with the investigational cancer immunotherapy atezolizumab in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.  

CMB305 is a prime-boost product designed to target tumors that express the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen, specifically soft tissue sarcoma.  NY-ES0-1 is expressed in a large number of solid and liquid state tumors in varying degrees.  CMB305 is comprised of two parts, a “prime” and a “boost”, which are designed to work synergistically to induce anti-tumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response targeting the NY-ES0-1-expressing tumors.  It is also hypothesized that CMB305 will also generate memory CTLs, providing for long-term immune response systems while enhancing other immune anti-tumor mechanisms along the way.  

Currently, CMB305 is in different stages of clinical development, which include monotherapy Phase I as well as a fully-enrolled Phase II trial comprised of individuals with two subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma (synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma).  This combination study is utilizing either CMB305 with Genetech’s cancer immunotherapy TECENTRIQ, or atezolizumab alone. 

Last year, the company reported positive clinical and biomarker data for CMB305 as a monotherapy.  In 25 soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients with recurrent disease treated with CMB305, median overall survival (mOS) had still not yet been reached, with an overall survival rate at 12 and 18 months of 83% and 76%, respectively. These data compare favorably to mOS for approved second line and later sarcoma agents, which is only 12.4-13.5 months, as well as a published mOS of 11.7 months for synovial sarcoma patients specifically; the largest patient population enrolled in this trial. A disease control rate of 64% was observed, including durable tumor growth arrest in patients who had evidence of disease progression at study entry. Also, CMB305 was well tolerated, and generated a strong and broad anti-NY-ESO-1 immune response in &gt;50% of the patients, including evidence of antigen spreading – the induction of an immune response against other tumor antigens not targeted by CMB305. In addition, the presented data showing a statistically-significant association of an induced response and clinical benefit in a pooled set of patients treated with CMB305 or LV305. The immune biomarkers studied, including novel bio-markers derived from public TCRS may guide regulatory strategy via the selection of patients more likely to have survival benefit on CMB305 therapy benchmarks. 

Immune Design has received Orphan Drug Designation in soft tissue sarcoma for both components of CMB305 in the EU and US, and depending upon further trial results soft tissue sarcoma will be the first indication in which CMB305 will be filed for regulatory approval.  There is a significant unmet need in this market, and the company holds the stance that the potential benefit of CMB305 to patients will be higher safety for patients and improved survival rates. 


#**Current and Forecasted Market:**

Synovial sarcoma is a cancer in the joints with a five-year and ten-year survival for people with Grade 3 tumors or metastatic disease of less than 25% and 15%, respectively, and Myxoid round cell liposarcoma is a malignant tumor that most often occurs in the deep-seated soft tissues of the extremities. Currently marketed treatments have high toxicity, with up to 37% of patients experiencing Grade 3/4 Adverse Events. 
Soft tissue sarcoma is rapidly growing, expected to reach a global CAGR of over 8% over the next 6 years.  With over 50 different types of soft tissue sarcoma, it is a rare and diverse group of cancers that can develop from nearly any tissue.  There are approximately 13,000 individuals who suffer from soft tissue sarcoma each year, and with a high incidence rate and increased awareness about the condition, the market is expected to continue to expand.  
The current soft tissue sarcoma market size is valued around $700 million as of 2017, and with an expected CAGR of more than 8%, In 2017, 12,715 new diagnosis and 5,070 deaths due to STS were reported in the U.S. Bone sarcomas accounted for 3,373 new cases and 1,649 deaths in 2017. The lifetime risk of developing a sarcoma is 0.4%. Approximately 45.0% of bone sarcomas and 21.0% of STS are diagnosed in people in the age group of 0-35 years.  Currently, chemotherapy and targeted therapy are the only approved treatments for sarcoma.  Several immuno-oncology agents are also under investigation, with Immune Design leading the forefront to fill this unmet market need. 


#**Competition:**

The largest market competition are companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, and Celgene and others.  However, not all of these companies are focusing on developments in immuno-oncology and developing long term body resistance to tumors.   There is a large market for immuno-oncology that is unmet and waiting to be filled.  Novartis holds roughly 30% of the market share for sarcoma treatment, which Immune Design seeks to start to take if the product becomes approved.  


Financials:

MDZ reported loss of 29 cents per share in second-quarter 2018, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 30 cents and the year-ago loss of 54 cents.

Immune Design’s shares have lost 8.9% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 1.2%.  However their revenues are up this quarter YOY to $0.76 million mainly due to the collaboration with Sanofi for G103 and product sales to collaboration partners.  R&amp;D expenses are increasing as they are moving along their extensive pipeline through the clinical phases.   

Biggest note on their finances, Immune Design expects cash on hand to be enough to fund operations through the second half of 2020.  Due to their strategic partnerships and financing, the company is able to limit diluting investors or taking on greater debt.  The company has enough cash and cash equivalents, $73 million, to finance all operations for more than a year, which is a very rare occurrence in these small cap biotech companies. 


#**Review:**

My sort of concerns, the low rate of success that oncology drug candidates have with the FDA.  Cancer is a tough market.  Data shows that cancer drugs have the lowest success rate of making it from Phase I to FDA approval, a mere 3.4%.  Although, cancer trials that used biomarkers had higher success rates, though, and the overall oncology drug approval rate for 2015 was 8.3%, which was due to the booming immuno-oncology field.  So, although oncology drugs lag, immuno-oncology pulls does not.  The past few years, especially under the Trump administration, drug approval rates have been higher than ever in recent history.  

For this product, Phase II studies patients and provides researchers with additional safety data to refine research questions and develop further methodologies to study the candidate and efficacy.  They utilize this data to formulate Phase III protocols.  Will not really reveal any benefits of the drug or therapeutic effects, rather simply show the safety of the product with some minor data.

As stated earlier, the company believes that CMB305 to patients will be higher safety for patients and improved survival rates.  Along with Orphan Designation and the need to get effective drugs approved in the Oncology market, I believe the FDA will try to push a product such as this through. I have no fear of dilution due to the cash on hand to hold them for another two years. 

Looking at their chart, the stock price has held a $3.30 support zone for the past year, consistently bouncing off of these low levels producing 10% plus gains and even going as far up as $5.00 just a few months ago.  The volatility of this stock is fairly high, and I would personally use this to my advantage.  They diluted with a $80 million offering in October 2017 causing a massive drop in share price.  I doubt the company will seek to ruin their shareholder base further any time soon.  I feel a purchase at under $3.40 is a great move and holding for $4.00 minimum.  


#**TLDR**:

Shit looks like a solid buy at this cheap support level.  They are showing safety in their studies or hinting at it, Phase II is all about safety, and with the Orphan Drug designation they have potential to meet a dire need.  Plenty of cash on hand, already screwed their investors with a dilution a year ago, dont have to worry about a dilution for another year or so as they have cash on hand to operate for two years.  I can see a 20-30% increase in the next month or two going from $3.30 to $4.00 as my minimum price target.

Over 100% of the float is shorted (yes for u retards this is poissible. Perelman has been snapping up shares and he wants to take the company private. They have a backdoor provision in their contracts to transfer assets away from bondholders similar to Jcrew. He wants to do this while private so they face less scrutiny etc.. whatever yada yada. Right now out of 53.5MM shares effectively 2.5MM is the float sine perelman has 85%, indexes, and a few other activists investors are holding and have the intent to hold for quite a long time as you can see by the mittleman brothers 13F filings. This thing could overshoot HEAVY in the near term and it looks like perelman is going to have to announce private real soon. He has used these tactics many times before (buy when underlying is depressed following poor earnings - even though this is attributed to front end costs). He has paid anywhere between 50-100% premium when taking companies private.

They are pretty expensive now when comparing their ev/sales to other high growth software companies.

$EVBG, however, is much more attractive. I believe it has a lot of upside that we can see in the next few months. They have a lot of long term contracts which helps reduce long term risk. They have strong, accelerating revenue growth and they are being smart in their efforts to balance growth vs their path towards profitability. They are currently trading at around 12.5x ev/2018 sales. IMO they warrant at least 16x, implying an upside of \~28%, or \~$74 per share (trades around $58 now). 16x ev/2018 sales would be much more in line with what we see in other small cap/high growth tech companies.

&amp;#x200B;

**DD**:

WSB listen up - Plug power is going to pop soon with a price target of $3.57, a 90% increase over its current price for the near term tendies. It will increase over the next quarter further as it completes its transition from research company to viable manufacturing company. I have 155 $3 11/16 calls for the near term tendies based around its 11/8 earning report, which I'll then turn over to 3/15 calls for the long term tendies where I expect it will jump yet further.

Walmart, Amazon, Nike, and FedEx have opened contracts with Plug Power for hydrogen powered forklifts and vehicles. Hydrogen power might seem lame but their niche is in industrial forklifts and local deliveries where time spent recharging is thousands of dollars a minute. Their CEO Andy Marsh has also been named to the U.S. Department of Energy Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technical Advisory Committee, giving the business the political connections it needs to succeed. Jonathan Silver, a member of the board of directors, is also a former US Department of Energy official. They are also pursuing European expansion to become an international company, where the political connections will offer them an advantage over their competitor Bloom Energy.

All eight of the board members have purchased hundreds of thousands of shares in the company four times since the beginning of the year, most recently in late August, signalling that they see a positive future for the company as it has turned around from a research company to a viable industrial and manufacturing business. Institutional investors have increased their stakes by millions of shares - Odey Asset Management Group Ltd bough an additional 2,330,000 shares increasing their stake in the company to 4,910,000 shares. Ignore the misleading title of the article and read content for a breakdown of the institutional investor increases: ([https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html](https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html))

This is also different than a vehicle running on LPG or other alternative fuel. The hydrogen isn't burned in the traditional sense, but is instead run through a membrane that strips the electrons from hydrogen using a catalyst and generates electricity directly from the reaction - the hydrogen then bonds with available oxygen and generates water as a byproduct. The advantage of this type of system is the reduced refueling/recharging time compared to traditional electric forklifts that are used in warehouses, and the reduced emissions compared to traditionally powered forklifts. Their systems are retrofit-capable and can be fitted to currently owned electric forklifts, reducing the overhead of purchasing all-new equipment.

They have also in-sourced the production of the membrane electrode assemblies to further reduce costs ([https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article](https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article)) and opened a new almost 40k SQFT factory in Rochester New York ([https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park](https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park)). They used to purchase their membranes for their equipment from their competitor Bloom Energy, and now that they are producing their own membranes they have announced two new pieces of technology - a new membrane that doubles the energy output of its fuel cell system. They have also partnered with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the US DOE to develop a robotic fueling station and reduces the time needed to refuel and allows the the usage of autonomous warehouse equipment powered by its system.

Their Research and Development side of the business has several late stage drug candidates in Phase III or have filed NDA, with one product in early stages at Phase I.  

*ALKS 5461 – NDA Filed for Major Depressive Disorder

*ALKS 3831 – Phase III for Schizophrenia

*BIIB098 (Formerly ALKS 8700) – Phase III for Multiple Sclerosis

*ALKS 4230 – Phase I in Immuno-oncology


Alkermes has two big FDA deadlines and events in the upcoming months which will be the focus of this write up.  The first is ALKS 5461 for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder with the FDA advisory committee discussing the NDA application for the drug candidate on November 1st as well as a PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  The second is ALKS 4230 for treatment of Solid Tumors, where they are reporting Phase I initial data in the second half of 2018.  I will be setting 2 dates for this write up to remind investors of the Advisory Meeting/data presentation sometime in the next 2 months, as well as the PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  With multiple catalysts in the pipeline in the next 3 months, Alkermes is an exciting company to watch.


**Specific Drugs:**

**ALKS 5461**

AKLS 5461, buprenorphine/samidorphan, is a k-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist which functions as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).  The buprenorphine is a partial agonist of µ-opioid receptors (MOR), antagonist of the KOR, as well as a slight antagonist of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and a weak agonist of the nociception receptor (NOP).  Samidorphan on the other hand is a preferential antagonist of the MOR, allowing for the combination of the two to function as a stopper to KORs with negligible activation of MORs.  
Essentially this means that by activating the KOR, opioid peptides which are endogenous ligands of the KOR and function by inversing morphine-like, euphoric endorphins, create a sense of dysphoria and psychotomimetic effects, and are to produce changes in neuroplasticity evoked by chronic stress that has led to the development of depression and CNS disorders and drug addiction.  It is suggested in research that inhibiting the KOR abolishes antidepressant-like effects of buprenorphine, but the drug exhibits both antagonistic and agonist properties.  This has led to the concern that in theory, ALKS-5461 could be limited in the effectiveness of treatment of depression.  

Granted a Fast Track Designation in 2013, the drug has proceeded up to Phase III where thee different trials were initiated for the treatment of depression.  The first two trials failed in 2016, FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, however based on the third trial, FORWARD-5, the company submitted an NDA in 2017 for ALKS-5461.  Things started to look grim for the company moving forward, as the FDA served Alkermes a refuse-to-file letter saying that more data from well-controlled clinical trials must be presented before an application would be recognized.  However, just two weeks after serving the notice, the FDA rescinded their letter and accepted the NDA after productive interactions with Alkermes where the company clarified certain aspects of the NDA.  No further data was needed to rescind the letter and PDUFA date is scheduled by January 31, 2019.

The first two trials failed after the company reported higher placebo responses as the chief obstacle in their studies.  Not something a company would like to hear in relation to an antidepressant medication.  Causing the stock to plummet 44% in 2016, from nearly $80 to under $40, the company has been slowly recovering since.  ALKS-5461’s fate lies in the hands of FORWARD-5, without a clear success and perfect data, an FDA approval seems unlikely for this drug. 

FORWARD-5 focused on two doses of 1mg/1mg and 2mg/2mg of ALKS-5461 for adjunct treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).  Concurrently to taking ALKS-5461, the patients also remained on background antidepressant therapy.  With 407 patients enrolled, 63 received 1mg/1mg, 63 received 2mg/2mg, and 280 received the placebo.  The study was conducted in two stages: Stage 1 was 5 weeks, Stage 2 was 6 weeks. In Stage 1, the average change from baseline depression scores was calculated for weeks 3 through 5. For Stage 2, the average change was calculated for weeks 3 through 6. Depression scores were assessed using the 6-item Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-6) and MADRS-10, an assessment tool for depression.

In the study, ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg met the prespecified primary endpoint of significantly reducing depression scores compared to placebo, as measured by 6-item MADRS scores (p=0.018). ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in 10-item MADRS scores compared to placebo (p=0.026). The 1mg/1mg dose of ALKS-5461 showed improvement in depressive symptoms in the study, but did not separate significantly from placebo.  2mg/2mg treatment did show a significant change, warranting its efficacy while also having no incidences of withdrawal or pattern of adverse effects suggesting abuse potential.  The clinical benefit of the compound maintained through 11-week study and the compound is relatively safe and tolerable.  Where FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 failed to meet their endpoints, FORWARD-5 succeed in meeting primary endpoint for the 2mg/2mg dose, showing great efficacy when compared to a placebo.   
November 1st, 2018, the FDA advisory committee is meeting to discuss ALKS-5471 in relation to the compound’s efficacy, safety and risk-benefit profile of the NDA for buprenorphine and samidorphan sublingual tablets for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.  In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee roughly 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  

**ALKS-4230**

Currently in Phase I of development, Alkermes does a change of pace with this immuno-oncology drug for the treatment of solid tumors, making a shift away from their regular market in the CNS disease space.  This drug candidate is an engineered fusion protein comprised of permuted interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2 Receptor (IL-2R) α made specifically to only activate the intermediate-affinity IL-2R.  The intermediate-affinity IL-2R is expressed mainly on effector lymphocytes, which are essential in generating an antitumor immune response.  IL-2 is a cell signaling molecule which plays a role in controlling the life cycle of specialized T-cells.  ALKS-4230 selectively binds to intermediate-affinity IL-2R to both activate and increase in number the immune cells that work to battle cancer.  Their selectivity, however, means they don’t bind to the “high-affinity IL-2 receptor,” so as not to trigger greater activity or proliferation in immune cells that could dampen an anti-tumor response Research has suggested that selective activation of the intermediate-affinity IL-2R by ALKS-4230 has the potential to provide enhanced tumor killing as well as improved tolerability. 
ALKS-4230 is currently in Phase I in patients with advanced solid tumors. Key study objectives are to determine a recommended phase 2 dose and characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and evidence of antitumor activity. A dose-escalation phase in patients with refractory solid tumors (Part A) will be followed by expansion cohorts in defined populations (Part B). ALKS 4230 is administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once daily for five days each cycle. The dose will be escalated until reaching maximum tolerated dose or an Optimal Biologic Dose. The first two dose cohorts will use a 3+3 design. Subsequent cohorts in Part A will enroll a minimum of 6 subjects. In Part B up to 21 patients will be enrolled into each of four tumor-specific cohorts. Peripheral blood samples will be collected for PK, immunogenicity and PD assessments. The primary PD endpoint is change-from-baseline in CD8+ T, NK and T reg cell counts. Other PD measures include serum concentrations of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and immunohistochemical assessment of markers of immune activation in tumor tissue from selected patients. 

Animal trials conducted previously were positive and showed the anti-tumor activity of ALKS-4230, both alone and with the checkpoint inhibitors. Rodents treated with ALKS-4230 were seen to have lesser tumor growth and better survival, supporting clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 as a potential immunotherapy in the oncology space. ALKS-4230 will be administered in combination with PD-1 inhibitor KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). Pembrolizumab is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells, complimenting the mechanisms of action from ALKS-4230.  Alkermes has accelerated clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 in combination with pembrolizumab based on data from the ongoing monotherapy dose-escalation stage of the phase 1 study, where ALKS 4230 demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacodynamic effects on circulating natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells, and minimal and non-dose dependent effects on immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.  

Initial data from Phase I is due in the second half of 2018, estimated to come out early November.


**Competition and Market:**

ALKS-4230 is a tough market, cancer is a hot sector but it continually sees failure.  While the FDA holds the stance that they want to try to push new oncology and immuno-oncology drugs through the approval process and get them to market to potentially save or extend lives, their decisions tend to skew otherwise.  Being so early on in development, it’s not necessary to dive into the market in depth as there is a large, unmet need in the oncology sector with the main focus being in immuno-oncology.

MDD has a multifaceted and varied etiology, and remains poorly understood. The MDD market is overly crowded and overly competitive, surpassing 30 FDA approved products available for the treatment of patients, the majority of which are now available as inexpensive generics. The MDD market is currently in an active transition where patents are expiring on top-selling products such as Eli Lilly's Cymbalta and Otsuka/BMS' Abilify, paving way for launches of Lundbeck/Takeda's Trintellix and Otsuka/Lundbeck's Rexulti.  These will create a significant growth in the market as cheaper generics will become available.  Growth in the MDD market is also expected to be driven by the potential introduction of numerous promising late-stage pipeline products into the market during the next few years which are directed at treatment-resistant patients.  These products include Alkermes' ALKS-5461, Allergan/Gedeon Richter/Mitsubishi Tanabe's Vraylar, Axsome Therapeutics' AXS-05, Janssen's esketamine, and Allergan's rapastinel.

MDD is the most common mental disorder in the U.S., affecting approximately 16 million American adults, of which about one-third remain untreated. The number of treated patients is projected to rise on account of expiring patents, the increase in available generic products, and rising awareness regarding depression and mental health issues.  This competitive market was priced at a massive $3.2 billion in 2015 and is expected to consistently grow at a CAGR of 6.1% until 2025 to reach $5.8 billion.  With the current social standings of mental health, students being required to take mandatory mental health courses now in many places, and social workers and therapists being more commonplace in schools and work places, we should see a larger surge in my opinion.  Growing female prevalence, increase in prescription spending, and escalating awareness of mental health will propel the growth of this market for many years to come.


**Financials:**

Alkermes has a great financial standing in the biotech industry.  Leveraging both their approved products and impressive collaborations, the company was able to boast a revenue growth of 39% ($304.6 million) through product sales and payments.  Many opportunities lined up for the company and set them up for success this second quarter. 

*Vivitrol sales increased 15% to $76.2 million

*Aristada sales increased 48% to $33.6 million

*Royalties from Johnson &amp; Johnson partnership increased 4% to $85.2 million

*Royalties from Acorda Therapeutics decreased 22% to $19.7 million

*License revenue from Biogen generated $48.3 million in revenue


Despite increased operation costs related to commercializing their products and further research and development, the company posted a Non-GAAP net income of $45.6 million and a Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.29. With a total cash balance of $561 million and total debt of $280 million, the company stands on strong ground.  This second half of 2018 has several catalysts, combined with increasing revenues from collaborations and drug approvals, Alkermes is likely to see success, only to be complimented by hopefully positive data from their upcoming Phase I and PDUFA dates. The company is expecting to hit $1 billion in revenues for 2018 as a year, which would be a massive milestone for the pharmaceutical company.


**Review:**

Historically, the FDA has been flexible with depression medications, but failures will weigh Alkermes down.  Depression studies have had a flurry of failures over recent history, and failure here can dissuade further research in the pharmaceutical space until more is known on the biology side.  With over 30 currently approved products on the market for MDD, it is overly saturated and failure can spell the end for the drug.  Following their failures in FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, investors are weary of another failure, especially after the initial NDA was rejected.  Good news is, there is an advisory committee meeting in November to discuss ALKS-5461. In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee only about 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  Chances are from that perspective that the FDA will grant approval.  The compound also shows no suggestion of tolerance of therapeutic effects, the side effect profile was generally comparable to standard medications with no significant late appearing side effects, and when medication was halted there was no sign of opioid withdrawal.  With the competitive, growing market and patents expiring, a new and novel MDD treatment would be a value add.

In the case of the early stage ALKS-4230, oncology drug candidates historically have a 57% possibility of success moving from Phase I to Phase II compared to an industry average of 63.2% possibility of success.  This does shine in comparison to the oncology end success rate of a low 3.4%.  If I were to put my money where my mouth is, I am going with the data and not the suggestive words of the FDA to say that oncology might sound like a great industry with the backing of the FDA, but their actions prove otherwise.  Oncology drugs are more likely to be denied by the FDA and fail their clinical trials at much higher rates than other industries such as vaccines which show an end rate of success over 30%.  I would guess this drug might make it to Phase III with time, but statistically it is unlikely to see approval.  While Phase III or even Phase II are years away from completion, the data in Phase I will likely reveal a lot about the drug to make future estimations off of.  I see Phase I being positive.

Currently the stock is trading around $43 and showing a high level of support and consolidation in this zone.  With a high of over $70 not 7 months ago, the company is likely to recover and soar.  This stock does not take bad news well however, seeing several 10% or more drops over the past year, but never going under $40 for long.  I think between $42-46 are great entries for this stock.  Long term their finances are growing, increasing revenues from royalties and sales of their own approved products, on track to hit $1 billion in revenues this year, and a solid pipeline that shows great promise.  I would bank on good data from ALKS-4230 as well as a positive hearing from the advisory committee.  With the PDUFA date in January, we will see a heavy run up into the end of the year.  I would take advantage of this price entry for either a long-term hold or a swing trade.  I would predict levels of up to $55 in the coming 3 months.

0,$WIN: Near pure arbitrage play for poor people who have patience . . . and want to make it rain,"If any of you fags can muster up some patience, there is a rare arbitrage opportunity in shares of $WIN, which is the result of some pricing disparities in the newly released Jan. 2021 options, combined with a very acute, and unexpected spike in implied volatility. The convergence of these 2 factors is allowing for some pretty ridiculous risk-reward profiles using a long collar strategy on $WIN shares.  

I opened the 2 positions below earlier today, and they are about as close as you can get to a pure arbitrage (i.e., completely risk-free) trade. To open a position, you buy the underlying $WIN shares, along with a Jan.21 option collar with a $5/$7 spread (buy the $5 put, and sell the $7 call).  Looks like there will still be good opportunities tomorrow to open these positions. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Position 1****:**

BUY - 10,000 Shares @ 5.06

BUY - 100 WIN Jan.21 $5.00 Puts @ $2.82

SELL - 100 WIN Jan.21 $7.00 Calls @ $2.84

(Net Collar Cost = -0.02 Credit)

**Position 2:**

BUY - 10,000 Shares @ 5.04

BUY - 100 WIN Jan.21 $5.00 Puts @ $2.66

SELL - 100 WIN Jan.21 $7.00 Calls @ $2.51

(Net Collar Cost = 0.15 Debit)

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, these trades are possible due to unusual disparity in put/call option pricing on the Jan.21 LEAPs, which allows you to initiate the collar at little or no cost. The end result is a long trade with substantial upside, and little to no downside exposure.  Both of my positions have upside of almost $2 per share, while limiting my maximum losses to just $0.04 per share for my first position, and $0.19 per share for my second position.  Here are the full risk-reward profiles for the 2 positions I opened today.  If you are using a margin account like I am, this strategy is absolutely cash-money since it costs practically nothing to open the position, but even with a cash account, this is still a compelling play. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Risk-Return Profile (Margin Account):**

*Position 1:*

Margin Required = $400

Max Gain = $1.96 per share ($19,600)

Max Loss = $0.04 per share ($400)

% Investment Return, Max Scenario = 4,900% 

*Position 2:*

Margin Required = $1,900

Max Gain = $1.81 per share ($18,100)

Max Loss = $0.19 per share ($1,900)

% Investment Return, Max Scenario = 952% 

&amp;#x200B;

**Risk-Return Profile (Cash Account):**

*Position 1:*

Cash Required = $50,400

Max Gain = $1.96 per share ($19,600)

Max Loss = $0.04 per share ($400)

% Investment Return, Max Scenario = 39% 

*Position 2:*

Cash Required = $51,900

Max Gain = $1.81 per share ($18,100)

Max Loss = $0.19 per share ($1,900)

% Investment Return, Max Scenario = 35% 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I’m not getting into any serious diligence here on $WIN as a company. $WIN is a struggling telecom provider in the midst of a turn-around effort that management believes will restore profitability and cash flow.  The company’s future is uncertain – it will either soar or sink in the next 3 years or so. Thanks to a successful debt restructuring earlier this year, the company’s near-term bond maturities have been pushed out to 2021, and the company’s cash flow is starting to improve. The key catalyst for the company will be the outcome of a litigation matter that went to trial this summer. It was a bond default dispute (Google it – there are a million articles). The decision could come out any day, and if $WIN prevails (as most people expect), then we’re going to see $WIN shares double (or more) almost immediately. If the company loses, it may have to explore bankruptcy options or a white-knight sale of the company’s assets. The outcome of this trial will dictate whether this trade pays off at the maximum level, or whether it’s a write-off. I’m ball-parking the odds of a favorable decision at 80%.

Guarantee you analysts will raise price targets tomorrow on the back of positive announcements at Signal conference. Pay partnership is with Stripe. Developers love Twilio

Stock has been hammered past two weeks due to global macro environment but fundamentals remain very strong

Twilio announced acquisition of sendgrid (leading email API platform) which basically rounds out the communications platform it offers. Email was the missing piece that people were wondering why Twilio doesn’t integrate and now they have it. Acquisition is via all-stock transaction. Despite this analysts remain bullish due to long term synergies and the fact that SendGrid userbase is different from Twilio’s which allows for cross selling opportunities 

Twilio build is a program for consulting/tech firms to help integrate Twilio with customers and spread awareness

Earnings date is scheduled for Nov 6 which is the day of the US house election. Twilio has developed an API for voting so there may be some parallels here between the two. 

Street Revenue estimates for Q3 aren’t even high and Twilio may blow past them given existing customers are spending more $ on increasing # of products 

TLDR: long TWLO calls expiring post earnings are the play here. Main risk is overall market selloff from worries around rising rates etc continuing causing tech shares to tumble further.
